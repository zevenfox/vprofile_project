# vprofile_project

This project is a comprehensive exploration of VM through the creation and deployment of a dynamic website written in Java. The primary objective is to gain a deeper understanding of Virtual Machines (VMs) and their role in hosting and scaling web applications.

## Key Components:

1. **MySQL (Database SVC):**
   - Utilizing MySQL as the database service for efficient data management.

2. **Memcache (DB Caching SVC):**
   - Implementing Memcache as a caching service to enhance database performance and reduce query response times.

3. **RabbitMQ (Broker/Queue SVC):**
   - Integrating RabbitMQ as the message broker and queue service to facilitate seamless communication between different components of the application.

4. **Tomcat (Application SVC):**
   - Deploying the Java web application on Apache Tomcat for a robust and scalable application server environment.

5. **Nginx (Web SVC):**
   - Configuring Nginx as the web service to handle HTTP requests, load balancing, and serving static content, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.
